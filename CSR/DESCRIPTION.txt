ðŸ“Œ Product Name
Nalgu â€“ CSR Transparency & Impact Tracking Platform
Tagline: From boardrooms to backyards
Sub-caption: The journey of impact â€” whole, warm, and true.

1. Product Overview
Nalgu is an AI-powered CSR transparency platform that connects corporates, NGOs, government, and citizens to ensure CSR funds are effectively utilized, transparently tracked, and publicly verifiable.
It solves the core issue of CSR accountability by enabling:

Corporates to see exactly where their funds go

NGOs to get visibility, faster funding, and credibility

Citizens to verify and approve impact in their community

Admins to monitor and enforce compliance

The platform runs on Supabase (secure backend), Bolt.new (responsive UI), and AI modules for project validation, auto-report generation, and impact analysis.

2. Problem Statement
Corporates spend thousands of crores annually on CSR but face trust issues and difficulty in tracking real impact.

NGOs struggle to showcase work effectively to attract funding.

Citizens have no official way to confirm whether promised benefits reach them.

Government & auditors lack real-time, reliable data for CSR compliance.

3. Target Users
